# Custom Start
**Current Version: v0.21**

Choose starting techs, bots, and home unit.

Full menu in Main Menu -> Options -> Mods -> CustomStart to help you start the game exactly as you want.

To play with the custom start, when starting a new game choose "CustomStart" instead of "Freeplay" as the starting scenario.

Should be compatible with all other mods, but since it is a scenario it can't be combined with other scenario mods. Might have issues if any mod removes the basic tech tree or any of the units CustomStart spawns and those options are selected in the menu.

# Features

**Choose "Home" Unit:**

- Default Mobile Command Center (same as base game)
- Mobile Command Center without deploy componant (for those who want to play a nomad game)

# Future Plans

- Add starting loadout options to dashbots and twinbots
- Home unit additional loadout(extra fabricator, assemblers, research pylon, more?)
- Figure out how to add starting drones.
- Clearly mark Challenge mode, re-balance, and cheat mode options
- Tooltips (looks like this might not be possible? Current widgets don't seem to support, would need to write my own.)
- Add presets on a dropdown (Current widgets don't seem to support, would need to write my own dropdown list.)
- More !?
